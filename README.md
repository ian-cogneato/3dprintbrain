### WORK-IN-PROGRESS

Bash configurator for converting NIfTI anatomical images into print-ready 3D meshes, per the pipeline described by @cmadan in https://riojournal.com/article/10398/. My goal is to build a functional configurator that will fetch and set up the necessary tools, then kick off the extraction and conversion process.
